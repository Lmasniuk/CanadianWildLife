<p class="align-center theContent">
    This version of the app has a homepage that includes a small description of the app, a search bar, a link to the animal index(browse) and a footer that assists donations to the WWF that is apparent on each page.

    <h3 class="align-center">Individuality and Shortcomings</h3>
    <br />
    <br />

    A general app design was agreed upon earlier on in the project and each group member
    has created a version of the app that looks and feels similar with minor differences. The search function 
    uses javascript to evaluate the search request. If the user enters a search query that matches an animal in our database exactly
    (unfortunately spelling is critical, but not capitalization) and clicks the search button,the user is alerted, and the browser is redirected to that animals page.
    Ideally the search bar would populate a list of results that are the same or similar to the input entered in real time. This would be done using AJAX and jQuery.
