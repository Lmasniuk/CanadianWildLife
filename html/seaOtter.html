        <p>The sea otter (Enhydra lutris) is a marine mammal native to the coasts of the northern and eastern North Pacific Ocean. Adult sea otters typically weigh between
            14 and 45 kg (30 and 100 lb), making them the heaviest members of the weasel family, but among the smallest marine mammals.
            Unlike most marine mammals, the sea otter's primary form of insulation is an exceptionally thick coat of fur, the densest in the animal kingdom.
            Although it can walk on land, the sea otter lives mostly in the ocean</p>
        <p>The sea otter inhabits offshore environments, where it dives to the sea floor to forage. It preys mostly on marine invertebrates such as sea urchins,
            various molluscs and crustaceans, and some species of fish. Its foraging and eating habits are noteworthy in several respects.
            First, its use of rocks to dislodge prey and to open shells makes it one of the few mammal species to use tools. ... <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_otter">(more info)</a></p>
