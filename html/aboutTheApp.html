    <h1 class="align-center">About the App</h1>



<p class="align-center theContent mainContent">
    It is important to note that this version of the application is only one of three implementations of the original app design. The particular version that I, Logan Masniuk, have developed is hosted on <a href="www.loganmasniuk.com">LoganMasniuk.com.</a>
    This version has a homepage that includes a small description of the app, a search bar, a link to the animal index(browse) and a footer that assists donations to the WWF that is apparent on each page.

    <h3 class="align-center">Individuality and Shortcomings</h3>
    <br />
    <br />

    There is few differences between the other two implementations of the app. A general app design was agreed upon earlier on in the project and each group member
    has created a version of the app that looks and feels similar with minor differences. The search function in the version hosted on this domain name
    uses javascript to evaluate the search request. If the user enters a search query that matches an animal in our database exactly
    (unfortunately spelling is critical, but not capitalization) and clicks the search button,the user is alerted, and the browser is redirected to that animals page.
    Ideally the search bar would populate a list of results that are the same or similar to the input entered in real time. This would be done using ajax and jQuery but I did not take this challenge upon myself yet.
    <br />
    In one different implementation of our teams app, the search request results in a list of animals that match the query that has been entered into the search bar asynchronously,
    this is possible because that implementation has the animal database set up as xml files which allows greater database extensibility and it is easier to work with in the long run.
